# StatChat: A Statistical Research GPT with DeepLake and Eurostat Integration

StatChat is an innovative GPT-based project designed to showcase new ways of interacting with statistical data. Leveraging the power of DeepLake and the Eurostat API, StatChat offers users an easy-to-use interface for querying statistical data and finding answers to specific and complex statistical questions, all grounded in reliable and open data sources. This project also demonstrates the performance improvements gained by integrating a GPT with a DeepLake vector store and enhancing search performance through the use of Deep Memory.

## Features
- **Data Querying**: Directly ask statistical questions and receive accurate, data-driven answers.
- **Deep Memory**: Utilizes DeepLake's Deep Memory feature for enhanced search performance.
- **Eurostat Integration**: Access to a vast array of statistical data from the Eurostat database.
- **Flask API**: A local API to bridge GPT interactions with DeepLake and Eurostat.
